# Project 1 - Search - CS420

## Overview
This project implements various search algorithms as part of the CS420 course. The goal is to visualize and understand different searching techniques such as Breadth-First Search (BFS), Depth-First Search (DFS), Uniform Cost Search (UCS), and A* Search. The project allows users to load a map from a file and initiate the selected search algorithm to explore the map visually.
